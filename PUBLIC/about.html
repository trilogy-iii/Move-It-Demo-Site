                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">ようこそ、Welcome! My name is Curtis Pitchford III. I'm a young multi-media specialist, polyglot and web developer.
                I've had a passion for design, technology and language from a young age. I was inspired by characters like
                Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark and have been on a mission to create ever since.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                    In middle school I studied perfoming arts such as band and theater. In high school, I studied robotics and manufacturing
                    at a career academy. In college, I studied film, 3D modeling and animation. Even after graduation, I've continued my
                    education
                    through my love for learning new languages. As of 2025, I have been studying Spanish and Japanese for over 5 years,
                    and I'm thinking of picking up Korean. But there are more languages than the kind you speak orally! I am also currently
                    learning
                    several programming languages online, such as HTML5, CSS, Python and Javascript.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                    While I may not be a super genius like Tony Stark or Bruce Wayne, my goal is to be as smart,
                    capable and interesting as I possibly can be; the best version of me.
                </p>
